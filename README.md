# Pokemon-game-insights
The purpose of this project was to answer  a couple of questions that would be relevant to a new player of the game. The results of this project enabled us to give data driven recommendations to new players increasing their chance of winning in the game.

# Pokemon
**Information about pokemon**

Pok√©mon is a role-playing game based around building a team made up of 6 monsters in order to win the highest number of battles. You can either battle other monsters in the wild which consist of random encounters with random pokemon or by battling a CPU or online players.

**Information about datasets** 

This project was built using 2 datasets. The first dataset included a list of all pokemon from generation 1 through 6 with their basic information. The second data set contains combat outcome between different pokemon.

**Questions I want to answer:**
1) What's the type of the most common pokemon?

2) Which pokemon type wins the most battles? What is it weakest against?

3) What's the best rounded pokemon?

4) What's the pokemon that wins the most? What type is it weakest against? What pokemon is it weakest against?

5) If I were up against a team of 6 pokemon, what's the likelihood of its composition? What team should I have?

6) If I were to play pokemon, which type of pokemon should I start with?

**Structure**
1) Explore data 

2) Transform data 

3) Answer the questions paired with visualizations

4) Results
