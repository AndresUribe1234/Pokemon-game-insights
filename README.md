# Pokemon-game-insights

The purpose of this project is to provide new players of the game with data-driven recommendations that will increase their chances of winning. To achieve this, we analyzed two datasets and answered several key questions about the game.

## Pokemon

Pokemon is a role-playing game that revolves around building a team of six monsters to win battles. Players can battle other monsters in the wild, which consist of random encounters with random Pokemon, or they can battle a CPU or online players.

## Datasets

This project uses two datasets:

1. A list of all Pokemon from generation 1 through 6, including their basic information.
2. A dataset containing combat outcomes between different Pokemon.

## Questions Answered

We answered the following questions:

1. What is the most common Pokemon type?
2. Which Pokemon type wins the most battles? What is it weakest against?
3. What is the best-rounded Pokemon?
4. What Pokemon wins the most? What type is it weakest against? What Pokemon is it weakest against?
5. If I were up against a team of six Pokemon, what is the likelihood of its composition? What team should I have?
6. If I were to play Pokemon, which type of Pokemon should I start with?

## Methodology

We followed the following methodology to answer the questions:

1. Explored the data to gain insights and identify trends.
2. Transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. Answered the questions using data-driven insights and paired them with visualizations.
4. Provided the results of our analysis.

## Results

Our analysis showed the following results:

1. The most common Pokemon type is water.
2. Dragon-type Pokemon win the most battles. They are weakest against fairy-type Pokemon.
3. The best-rounded Pokemon is Eevee.
4. Kangaskhan wins the most battles. It is weakest against fairy-type Pokemon and is also weak against fighting-type Pokemon.
5. The likelihood of a team's composition varies, but it is essential to have a well-rounded team that covers various Pokemon types.
6. New players should start with either fire, water, or grass-type Pokemon as they are well-rounded and have many advantages.

We hope that this project will help new players of Pokemon make informed decisions and increase their chances of winning battles.
